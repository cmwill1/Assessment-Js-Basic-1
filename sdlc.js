// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//From 1-6 steps of software development starting with first step. 

1. Planning
2. Analysis of Requirments
3. Design
4. Testing & Integration
5. Implementation
6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step, where the needs of the client/consumers are evaluated against the requirments for the end product or solution." 
const design = "This is the third step, where the requirements will help shape the look of the final product and a blueprint can be formed."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fourth step, where all functions of the project created thus far will be challenged and also run through quality assurance measures."
const implementation = "This is the sixth step, where the project will be put into production now that the steps above have been completed and are satisfied."
const maintain = "This is the final step, where new ideas or updates can be made as needed."
